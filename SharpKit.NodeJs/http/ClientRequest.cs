    /// <p>This object is created internally and returned from <code>http.request()</code>.  It
    /// represents an <em>in-progress</em> request whose header has already been queued.  The
    /// header is still mutable using the <code>setHeader(name, value)</code>, <code>getHeader(name)</code>,
    /// <code>removeHeader(name)</code> API.  The actual header will be sent along with the first
    /// data chunk or when closing the connection.
    /// </p>
    /// <p>To get the response, add a listener for <code>&apos;response&apos;</code> to the request object.
    /// <code>&apos;response&apos;</code> will be emitted from the request object when the response
    /// headers have been received.  The <code>&apos;response&apos;</code> event is executed with one
    /// argument which is an instance of <code>http.ClientResponse</code>.
    /// </p>
    /// <p>During the <code>&apos;response&apos;</code> event, one can add listeners to the
    /// response object; particularly to listen for the <code>&apos;data&apos;</code> event. Note that
    /// the <code>&apos;response&apos;</code> event is called before any part of the response body is received,
    /// so there is no need to worry about racing to catch the first part of the
    /// body. As long as a listener for <code>&apos;data&apos;</code> is added during the <code>&apos;response&apos;</code>
    /// event, the entire body will be caught.
