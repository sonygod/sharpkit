This class defines the essential API of plugins as used by Components by defining the following methods:  init : The plugin initialization method which the owning Component calls at Component initialization
    /// time.The Component passes itself as the sole parameter.Subclasses should set up bidirectional
    /// links between the plugin and its client Component here. destroy : The plugin cleanup method which the owning Component calls at Component destruction time.Use
    /// this method to break links between the plugin and the Component and to free any allocated resources. enable : The base implementation just sets the plugin&#39;s disabled flag to false disable : The base implementation just sets the plugin&#39;s disabled flag to true
