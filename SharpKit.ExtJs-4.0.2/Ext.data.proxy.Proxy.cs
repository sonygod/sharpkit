    /// <summary>
    /// Proxies are used by Stores to handle the loading and saving of Model data.
    /// Usually developers will not need to create or interact with proxies directly. Types of Proxy There are two main types of Proxy - Client and Server. The Client proxies
    /// save their data locally and include the following subclasses:  LocalStorageProxy - saves its data to localStorage if the browser supports it SessionStorageProxy - saves its data to sessionStorage if the browsers supports it MemoryProxy - holds data in memory only, any data is lost when the page is refreshed  The Server proxies save their data by sending requests to some remote server. These proxies include:  Ajax - sends requests to a server on the same domain JsonP - uses JSON-P to send requests to a server on a different domain Direct - uses Ext.direct to send requests  Proxies operate on the principle that all operations performed are either Create, Read, Update or Delete. These four operations
    /// are mapped to the methods create, read, update and destroy respectively. Each Proxy subclass
    /// implements these functions. The CRUD methods each expect an Operation object as the sole argument. The Operation encapsulates
    /// information about the action the Store wishes to perform, the model instances that are to be modified, etc.
    /// See the Operation documentation for more details. Each CRUD method also accepts a callback function to be
    /// called asynchronously on completion. Proxies also support batching of Operations via a batch object, invoked by the batch method.
