    /// other DragDrop objects. handle element(s): The drag operation only occurs if the element that
    /// was clicked matches a handle element.  By default this is the linked
    /// element, but there are times that you will want only a portion of the
    /// linked element to initiate the drag operation, and the setHandleElId()
    /// method provides a way to define this. drag element: this represents the element that would be moved along
    /// with the cursor during a drag operation.  By default, this is the linked
    /// element itself as in Ext.dd.DD.  setDragElId() lets you define
