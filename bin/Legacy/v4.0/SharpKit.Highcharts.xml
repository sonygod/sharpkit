            <summary>
            A chart can have from 0 axes (pie chart) to multiples. In a normal, single seriescartesian chart, there is one X axis and one Y axis.
            The X axis or axes are referencedby chart.xAxis, which is an array of Axis objects.
            If there is only oneaxis, it can be referenced through chart.xAxis[0], and multiple axes haveincreasing indices. The same pattern goes for Y axes.
            If you need to get the axes from a series object, use the series.xAxis andseries.yAxis properties.
            These are not arrays, as one series can only be associateddto one X and one Y axis.
            A third way to reference the axis programmatically is by id. Add an id in the axis configuration options, and get the axis by chart.get(id).
            Configuration options for the axes are given in options.xAxis and options.yAxis.

            All series and point event handlersgive a reference to the series object.
            The chart object has a seriesproperty that is a collection of all the chart's series.
            The point objectsalso have the same reference.
            Another way to reference the series programmatically is by id.
            Add an id in the series configuration options, and get the series object by chart.get(id).
            Configuration options for the series are given in three levels.
            Optionsfor all series in a chart are given in the plotOptions.series object.
            Then options for all seriesof a specific type are given in the plotOptions of that type,
            for example plotOptions.line.Next, options for one single series are given in the series array.

            The Renderer's methods are chained whereever possible, so you can initiate an element then call for example attrand css and add on that element in one statement.

            Callback function to format the text of the tooltip. Return false to disable tooltip for a specific point on series.
            A subset of HTML is supported. The HTML of the tooltip is parsed and converted to SVG, therefore this isn't a complete HTML renderer.
            The following tabs are supported: &lt;b>, &lt;strong>, &lt;i>, &lt;em>, &lt;br/>, &lt;span>.
            Spans can be styled with a style attribute, but only text-related CSS that is shared with SVG is handled.
            Since version 2.1 the tooltip can be shared between multiple series through the shared option.
            The available data in the formatter differ a bit depending on whether the tooltip is shared or not. In a shared tooltip, all properties except x, which is common for all points, are kept in an array, this.points.
            Available data are:
            this.percentage (not shared) / this.points[i].percentage (shared)
            Stacked series and pies only. The point's percentage of the total.
            this.point (not shared) / this.points[i].point (shared)
            The point object. The point name, if defined, is available through this.point.name.
            this.points
            In a shared tooltip, this is an array containing all other properties for each point.
            this.series (not shared) / this.points[i].series (shared)
            The series object. The series name is available through this.series.name.
            this.total (not shared) / this.points[i].total (shared)
            Stacked series only. The total value at this point's x value.
            this.x
            The x value. This property is the same regardless of the tooltip being shared or not.
            this.y (not shared) / this.points[i].y (shared)
            The y value.

            Furthermore, point.y can be extended by the tooltip.yPrefix and tooltip.ySuffix variables.
            This can also be overridden for each series, which makes it a good hook for displaying units.
            Defaults to &lt;span style="color:{series.color}">{series.name}&lt;/span>: &lt;b>{point.y}&lt;/b>&lt;br/>

            The callback receives three parameters: labelWidth, labelHeight and point,
            where point contains values for plotX and plotY telling where the reference point is in the plot area.
            The return should be an object containing x and y values, for example { x: 100, y: 100 }.

            In a column chart, when pointPlacement is "on", the point will not create any padding of the X axis.
            In a polar column chart this means that the first column points directly north.
            If the pointPlacement is "between", the columns will be laid out between ticks.
            This is useful for example for visualising an amount between two points in time or in a certain sector of a polar chart.

            The advantage of drawing all points (including markers and columns), is that animation is performed on updates.
            On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area.
            The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series. . Defaults to 300.

            An array of data points for the series. The points can be given in three ways:
            A list of numerical values. In this case, the numberical values will be interpreted and y values,
            and x values will be automatically calculated, either starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, or from pointStart and pointInterval given in the plotOptions.
            If the axis is has categories, these will be used. This option is not available for range series. Example:
            data: [0, 5, 3, 5]
            A list of arrays with two values. In this case, the first value is the x value and the second is the y value. If the first value is a string, it is applied as the name of the point, and the x value is incremented following the above rules.
            
            For range series, the arrays will be interpreted as [x, low, high]. In this cases, the X value can be skipped altogether to make use of pointStart and pointRange.

            <summary>
            The minimum range to display on this axis. The entire axis will not be allowed to span over a smaller interval than this.
            For example, for a datetime axis the main unit is milliseconds. If minRange is set to 3600000, you can't zoom in more than to one hour.
            The default minRange for the x axis is five times the smallest interval between any of the data points.
            On a logarithmic axis, the unit for the minimum range is the power. So a minRange of 1 means that the axis can be zoomed to 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10000 etc.

            <summary>
            Tick interval in scale units for the minor ticks.
            On a linear axis, if "auto", the minor tick interval is calculated as a fifth of the tickInterval. If null, minor ticks are not shown.
            On logarithmic axes, the unit is the power of the value.
            For example, setting the minorTickInterval to 1 puts one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc. Setting the minorTickInterval to 0.1 produces 9 ticks between 1 and 10, 10 and 100 etc.
            A minorTickInterval of "auto" on a log axis results in a best guess, attempting to enter approximately 5 minor ticks between each major tick.

            The default minRange for the x axis is five times the smallest interval between any of the data points.
            On a logarithmic axis, the unit for the minimum range is the power. So a minRange of 1 means that the axis can be zoomed to 10-100, 100-1000, 1000-10000 etc.

            If null, minor ticks are not shown.
            On logarithmic axes, the unit is the power of the value.
            For example, setting the minorTickInterval to 1 puts one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc.
            Setting the minorTickInterval to 0.1 produces 9 ticks between 1 and 10, 10 and 100 etc.
            A minorTickInterval of "auto" on a log axis results in a best guess, attempting to enter approximately 5 minor ticks between each major tick.

            <summary>
            The interval of the tick marks in axis units. When null, the tick interval is computed to approximately follow the tickPixelInterval on linear and datetime axes.
            On categorized axes, a null tickInterval will default to 1, one category.
            Note that datetime axes are based on milliseconds, so for example an interval of one day is expressed as 24 * 3600 * 1000.
            On logarithmic axes, the tickInterval is based on powers, so a tickInterval of 1 means one tick on each of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 etc.
            A tickInterval of 2 means a tick of 0.1, 10, 1000 etc. A tickInterval of 0.2 puts a tick on 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 20, 40 etc.
