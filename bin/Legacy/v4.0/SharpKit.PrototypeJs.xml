            Alias of: Element.extend
            Extends the given element instance with all of the Prototype goodness and syntactic sugar, as well as any extensions added via Element.addMethods.
            (If the element instance was already extended, this is a no-op.)
            You only need to use Element.extend on element instances you've acquired directly from the DOM;
            all Prototype methods that return element instances (such as $, Element.down, etc.) will pre-extend the element before returning it.
            Check out "How Prototype extends the DOM" for more about element extensions.
            Specifically, Element.extend extends the given instance with the methods contained in Element.Methods and Element.Methods.Simulated.
            If element is an input, textarea, or select element, it will also be extended with the methods from Form.Element.Methods.
            If it is a form element, it will also be extended with the methods from Form.Methods.

            Finds the computed width and height of element and returns them as key/value pairs of an object.
            For backwards-compatibility, these dimensions represent the dimensions of the element's "border box" (including CSS padding and border).

            Note that all values are returned as numbers only although they are expressed in pixels.
            Caveats:
            If the element is hidden via display: none in CSS, this method will attempt to measure the element by temporarily removing that CSS and applying visibility:
            hidden and position: absolute. This gives the element dimensions without making it visible or affecting the positioning of surrounding elements —
            but may not give accurate results in some cases. Element.measure is designed to give more accurate results.
            In order to avoid calling the method twice, you should consider caching the returned values in a variable, as shown in the example below.
            For more complex use cases, use Element.measure, which is able to measure many different aspects of an element's dimensions and offsets.

            Two elements are siblings if they have the same parent. So for example, the &lt;head> and &lt;body> elements are siblings (their parent is the &lt;html> element).
            Previous-siblings are simply the ones which precede element in the document.
            The returned Array reflects the siblings inversed order in the document (e.g. an index of 0 refers to the lowest sibling i.e., the one closest to element).

            More information:
            This method is used internally by Element.ancestors, Element.descendants, Element.nextSiblings,
            Element.previousSiblings and Element.siblings which offer really convenient way to grab elements,
            so directly accessing Element.recursivelyCollect should seldom be needed. However, if you are after something out of the ordinary, it is the way to go.

            Replaces element itself with newContent and returns element.
            Keep in mind that this method returns the element that has just been removed — not the element that took its place.
            newContent can be either plain text, an HTML snippet or any JavaScript object which has a toString() method.
            If newContent contains any &lt;script> tags, these will be evaluated after element has been replaced (Element.replace internally calls String#evalScripts).
            Note that if no argument is provided, Element.replace will simply clear element of its content.
            However, using Element.remove to do so is both faster and more standard compliant.
            Warning:
            Using Element.replace as an instance method (e.g., $('foo').replace('&lt;p>Bar&lt;/p>')) causes errors in Opera 9 when used on input elements.
            The replace property is reserved on input elements as part of Web Forms 2. As a workaround, use the generic version instead (Element.replace('foo', '&lt;p>Bar&lt;/p>')).

            Returns element's first ancestor (or the Nth ancestor, if index is specified) that matches expression.
            If no expression is provided, all ancestors are considered. If no ancestor matches these criteria, undefined is returned.
            More information:
            The Element.up method is part of Prototype's ultimate DOM traversal toolkit (check out Element.down,
            Element.next and Element.previous for some more Prototypish niceness). It allows precise index-based and/or CSS rule-based selection of any of element's ancestors.
            As it totally ignores text nodes (it only returns elements), you don't have to worry about whitespace nodes.
            And as an added bonus, all elements returned are already extended (see Element.extended) allowing chaining.

            Hash can be thought of as an associative array, binding unique keys to values (which are not necessarily unique),
            though it can not guarantee consistent order its elements when iterating. Because of the nature of JavaScript, every object is in fact a hash;
            but Hash adds a number of methods that let you enumerate keys and values, iterate over key/value pairs, merge two hashes together, and much more.

            The namespace for Prototype's event system.
            Events: a fine mess:
            Event management is one of the really sore spots of cross-browser scripting.
            True, the prevalent issue is: everybody does it the W3C way, and MSIE does it another way altogether. But there are quite a few subtler, sneakier issues here and there waiting to bite your ankle — such as the keypress/keydown issue with KHTML-based browsers (Konqueror and Safari). Also, MSIE has a tendency to leak memory when it comes to discarding event handlers.
            Prototype to the rescue:
            Of course, Prototype smooths it over so well you'll forget these troubles even exist. Enter the Event namespace. It is replete with methods that help to normalize the information reported by events across browsers.
            Event also provides a standardized list of key codes you can use with keyboard-related events, including KEY_BACKSPACE, KEY_TAB, KEY_RETURN, KEY_ESC, KEY_LEFT, KEY_UP, KEY_RIGHT, KEY_DOWN, KEY_DELETE, KEY_HOME, KEY_END, KEY_PAGEUP, KEY_PAGEDOWN and KEY_INSERT.
            The functions you're most likely to use a lot are Event.observe, Event.element and Event.stop. If your web app uses custom events, you'll also get a lot of mileage out of Event.fire.
            Instance methods on event objects:
            As of Prototype 1.6, all methods on the Event object are now also available as instance methods on the event object itself:

            <summary>
            Stops the event's propagation and prevents its eventual default action from being triggered.
            Stopping an event also sets a stopped property on that event for future inspection.
            There are two aspects to how your browser handles an event once it fires up:
            The browser usually triggers event handlers on the actual element the event occurred on,
            then on its parent element, and so on and so forth, until the document's root element is reached. This is called event bubbling,
            and is the most common form of event propagation. You may very well want to stop this propagation when you just handled an event,
            and don't want it to keep bubbling up (or see no need for it).
            Once your code had a chance to process the event, the browser handles it as well, if that event has a default behavior.
            For instance, clicking on links navigates to them; submitting forms sends them over to the server side;
            hitting the Return key in a single-line form field submits it; etc. You may very well want to prevent this default behavior if you do your own handling.
            Because stopping one of those aspects means, in 99.9% of the cases, preventing the other one as well, Prototype bundles both in this stop function.
            Calling it on an event object, stops propagation and prevents the default behavior.
            This method can be called either as an instance method or as a generic method. If calling as a generic, pass the instance in as the first argument.

            If its second argument is a string String#gsub works just like the native JavaScript method replace() set to global match.
            If you pass it a function, it will be invoked for every occurrence of the pattern with the match of the current pattern as its unique argument.
            Note that this argument is the returned value of the match() method called on the current pattern.
            It is in the form of an array where the first element is the entire match and every subsequent one corresponds to a parenthesis group in the regex.
            Lastly, you can pass String#gsub a Template string in which you can also access the returned value of the match() method using the ruby inspired notation:
            #{0} for the first element of the array, #{1} for the second one, and so on. So our last example could be easily re-written as:
            If you need an equivalent to String#gsub but without global match set on, try String#sub.
            Note: Do not use the "g" flag on the regex as this will create an infinite loop.

            If its second argument is a string String#gsub works just like the native JavaScript method replace() set to global match.
            If you pass it a function, it will be invoked for every occurrence of the pattern with the match of the current pattern as its unique argument.
            Note that this argument is the returned value of the match() method called on the current pattern.
            It is in the form of an array where the first element is the entire match and every subsequent one corresponds to a parenthesis group in the regex.
            Lastly, you can pass String#gsub a Template string in which you can also access the returned value of the match() method using the ruby inspired notation:
            #{0} for the first element of the array, #{1} for the second one, and so on. So our last example could be easily re-written as:
            If you need an equivalent to String#gsub but without global match set on, try String#sub.
            Note: Do not use the "g" flag on the regex as this will create an infinite loop.

            Prototype extends all native JavaScript arrays with quite a few powerful methods.
            This is done in two ways:
            It mixes in the Enumerable module, which brings in a ton of methods.
            It adds quite a few extra methods, which are documented in this section.
            With Prototype, arrays become much, much more than the trivial objects we used to manipulate,
            limiting ourselves to using their length property and their [] indexing operator.
            They become very powerful objects that greatly simplify the code for 99% of the common use cases involving them.

            Enumerable provides a large set of useful methods for enumerations — objects that act as collections of values. It is a cornerstone of Prototype.
            Enumerable is a mixin: a set of methods intended not for standaone use, but for incorporation into other objects.
            Prototype mixes Enumerable into several classes. The most visible cases are Array and Hash,
            but you'll find it in less obvious spots as well, such as in ObjectRange and various DOM- or Ajax-related objects.

            Extensions to the built-in Object object.
            Because it is dangerous and invasive to augment Object.prototype (i.e., add instance methods to objects),
            all these methods are static methods that take an Object as their first parameter.
            Object is used by Prototype as a namespace; that is, it just keeps a few new methods together,
            which are intended for namespaced access (i.e. starting with "Object.").
            For the regular developer (who simply uses Prototype without tweaking it),
            the most commonly used methods are probably Object.inspect and, to a lesser degree, Object.clone.
            Advanced users, who wish to create their own objects like Prototype does, or explore objects as if they were hashes,
            will turn to Object.extend, Object.keys, and Object.values.

            A succession of values.
            An ObjectRange can model a range of any value that implements a succ method (which links that value to its "successor").
            Prototype provides such a method for Number and String, but you are (of course) welcome to implement useful semantics in your own objects,
            in order to enable ranges based on them.
            ObjectRange mixes in Enumerable, which makes ranges very versatile. It takes care, however, to override the default code for include, to achieve better efficiency.
            While ObjectRange does provide a constructor, the preferred way to obtain a range is to use the $R utility function, which is strictly equivalent (only way more concise to use).
            See $R for more information.

            Oversees the calling of a particular function periodically.
            PeriodicalExecuter shields you from multiple parallel executions of a callback function, should it take longer than the given interval to execute.
            This is especially useful if you use one to interact with the user at given intervals (e.g. use a prompt or confirm call):
            this will avoid multiple message boxes all waiting to be actioned.

            A class for sophisticated string interpolation.
            Any time you have a group of similar objects and you need to produce formatted output for these objects,
            maybe inside a loop, you typically resort to concatenating string literals with the object's fields:
            "The TV show " + title + " was created by " + author + "."
            There's nothing wrong with this approach, except that it is hard to visualize the output immediately just by glancing at the concatenation expression.
            The Template class provides a much nicer and clearer way of achieving this formatting.

            In the optional options hash, you usually provide an onComplete and/or onSuccess callback,

            <summary>
            A repository of global listeners notified about every step of Prototype-based Ajax requests.
            Sometimes, you need to provide generic behaviors over all Ajax operations happening on the page (through Ajax.Request, Ajax.Updater or Ajax.PeriodicalUpdater).
            For instance, you might want to automatically show an indicator when an Ajax request is ongoing, and hide it when none are.
            You may well want to factor out exception handling as well, logging those somewhere on the page in a custom fashion. The possibilities are myriad.
            To achieve this, Prototype provides Ajax.Responders, which lets you register (and, if you wish, unregister later) responders, which are objects with specially-named methods.
            These names come from a set of general callbacks corresponding to different points in time (or outcomes) of an Ajax request's life cycle.
            For instance, Prototype automatically registers a responder that maintains a nifty variable: Ajax.activeRequestCount.
            This represents, at a given time, the number of currently active Ajax requests — by monitoring their onCreate and onComplete events.

            As always, unregistering something requires you to use the very same object you used at registration.
            If you plan to use unregister, be sure to assign your responder to a variable before passing it into Ajax.Responders#register — don't pass it an object literal.

            the XMLHttpRequest object, and the result of evaluating the X-JSON response header, if any (can be null).

            <summary>
            A convenience method for serializing and submitting the form via an Ajax.Request to the URL of the form's action attribute.
            The options parameter is passed to the Ajax.Request instance, allowing one to override the HTTP method and/or specify additional parameters and callbacks.
            If the form has a method attribute, its value is used for the Ajax.Request method option. If a method option is passed to request(),
            it takes precedence over the form's method attribute. If neither is specified, method defaults to "POST".
            Key-value pairs specified in the parameters option (either as a hash or a query string) will be merged with (and take precedence over) the serialized form parameters.

            The options allow you to control two things: What kind of return value you get (an object or a string),
            and whether and which submit fields are included in that object or string.
            If you do not supply an options object at all, the options { hash: false } are used.
            If you supply an options object, it may have the following options:

        <member name="P:SharpKit.PrototypeJs.Form.SerializeOptions.hash">
            <summary>
             true to return a plain object with keys and values (not a Hash; see below), false to return a String in query string format.
             If you supply an options object with no hash member, hash defaults to true.
             Note that this is not the same as leaving off the options object entirely (see above)

             Note that the false value must really be false, not falsey; falsey-but-not-false is like omitting the option.

        <member name="T:SharpKit.PrototypeJs.Form.Element2.Observer">
            <summary>
            An Abstract.TimedObserver subclass that watches for changes to a form field's value.
            This triggers the callback when the form field's value (according to Form.Element.getValue) changes.
            (Note that when the value actually changes can vary from browser to browser, particularly with select boxes.)
            Form.Element observer implements the getValue() method using Form.Element.getValue on the given element.
            See Abstract.TimedObserver for general documentation on timed observers.
