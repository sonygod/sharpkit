            Models are the heart of any JavaScript application, containing the interactive data as well as a large part of the logic surrounding it: conversions, validations, computed properties, and access control.
            You extend Backbone.Model with your domain-specific methods, and Model provides a basic set of functionality for managing changes.
            The following is a contrived example, but it demonstrates defining a model with a custom method, setting an attribute, and firing an event keyed to changes in that specific attribute.
            After running this code once, sidebar will be available in your browser's console, so you can play around with it.

            <summary>
            When creating an instance of a model, you can pass in the initial values of the attributes, which will be set on the model.
            If you define an initialize function, it will be invoked when the model is created.
            In rare cases, if you're looking to get fancy, you may want to override constructor, which allows you to replace the actual constructor function for your model.

             To create a Model class of your own, you extend Backbone.Model and provide instance properties,

             extend correctly sets up the prototype chain, so subclasses created with extend can be further extended and subclassed as far as you like.

             Override this if you need to work with a preexisting API, or better namespace your responses.
             If you're working with a Rails backend, you'll notice that Rails' default to_json implementation includes a model's attributes under a namespace.

             parse is called by Backbone whenever a collection's models are returned by the server, in fetch.
             The function is passed the raw response object, and should return the array of model attributes to be added to the collection.
             The default implementation is a no-op, simply passing through the JSON response.
             Override this if you need to work with a preexisting API, or better namespace your responses
             Note that afterwards, if your model class already has a parse function, it will be run against each fetched model.

            The options hash takes success and error callbacks which will be passed (collection, response) as arguments.
            When the model data returns from the server, the collection will reset.
            Delegates to Backbone.sync under the covers for custom persistence strategies and returns a jqXHR.
            The server handler for fetch requests should return a JSON array of models.
            If you'd like to add the incoming models to the current collection, instead of replacing the collection's contents, pass {add: true} as an option to fetch.
            jQuery.ajax options can also be passed directly as fetch options, so to fetch a specific page of a paginated collection: Documents.fetch({data: {page: 3}})
            Note that fetch should not be used to populate collections on page load — all models needed at load time should already be bootstrapped in to place.
            fetch is intended for lazily-loading models for interfaces that are not needed immediately:
            for example, documents with collections of notes that may be toggled open and closed.

             <summary>
             By default there is no comparator function on a collection. If you define a comparator, it will be used to maintain the collection in sorted order.
             This means that as models are added, they are inserted at the correct index in collection.models.
             Comparator function can be defined as either a sortBy (pass a function that takes a single argument),
             or as a sort (pass a comparator function that expects two arguments).
             "sortBy" comparator functions take a model and return a numeric or string value by which the model should be ordered relative to others.
             "sort" comparator functions take two models, and return -1 if the first model should come before the second,
             0 if they are of the same rank and 1 if the first model should come after.
             Collections with comparator functions will not automatically re-sort if you later change model attributes, so you may wish to call sort after changing model attributes that would affect the order.

             <summary>
             By default there is no comparator function on a collection. If you define a comparator, it will be used to maintain the collection in sorted order.
             This means that as models are added, they are inserted at the correct index in collection.models.
             Comparator function can be defined as either a sortBy (pass a function that takes a single argument),
             or as a sort (pass a comparator function that expects two arguments).
             "sortBy" comparator functions take a model and return a numeric or string value by which the model should be ordered relative to others.
             "sort" comparator functions take two models, and return -1 if the first model should come before the second,
             0 if they are of the same rank and 1 if the first model should come after.
             Collections with comparator functions will not automatically re-sort if you later change model attributes, so you may wish to call sort after changing model attributes that would affect the order.

            Web applications often provide linkable, bookmarkable, shareable URLs for important locations in the app.
            Until recently, hash fragments (#page) were used to provide these permalinks, but with the arrival of the History API,
            it's now possible to use standard URLs (/page). Backbone.Router provides methods for routing client-side pages, and connecting them to actions and events.
            For browsers which don't yet support the History API, the Router handles graceful fallback and transparent translation to the fragment version of the URL.
            During page load, after your application has finished creating all of its routers, be sure to call Backbone.history.start(),
            or Backbone.history.start({pushState: true}) to route the initial URL.

             <summary>
             The routes hash maps URLs with parameters to functions on your router, similar to the View's events hash.
             Routes can contain parameter parts, :param, which match a single URL component between slashes; and splat parts *splat, which can match any number of URL components.
             For example, a route of "search/:query/p:page" will match a fragment of #search/obama/p2, passing "obama" and "2" to the action.
             A route of "file/*path" will match #file/nested/folder/file.txt, passing "nested/folder/file.txt" to the action.
             When the visitor presses the back button, or enters a URL, and a particular route is matched, the name of the action will be fired as an event,
             so that other objects can listen to the router, and be notified. In the following example, visiting #help/uploading will fire a route:help event from the router.

            <summary>
            History serves as a global router (per frame) to handle hashchange events or pushState, match the appropriate route, and trigger callbacks.
            You shouldn't ever have to create one of these yourself — you should use the reference to Backbone.history that will be created for you automatically
            if you make use of Routers with routes.
            pushState support exists on a purely opt-in basis in Backbone. Older browsers that don't support pushState will continue to use hash-based URL fragments,
            and if a hash URL is visited by a pushState-capable browser, it will be transparently upgraded to the true URL.
            Note that using real URLs requires your web server to be able to correctly render those pages, so back-end changes are required as well.
            For example, if you have a route of /documents/100, your web server must be able to serve that page, if the browser visits that URL directly.
            For full search-engine crawlability, it's best to have the server generate the complete HTML for the page ... but if it's a web application,
            just rendering the same content you would have for the root URL, and filling in the rest with Backbone Views and JavaScript works fine.

            Backbone views are almost more convention than they are code — they don't determine anything about your HTML or CSS for you,
            and can be used with any JavaScript templating library.
            The general idea is to organize your interface into logical views, backed by models,
            each of which can be updated independently when the model changes, without having to redraw the page.
            Instead of digging into a JSON object, looking up an element in the DOM, and updating the HTML by hand,
            you can bind your view's render function to the model's "change" event — and now everywhere that model data is displayed in the UI, it is always immediately up to date.

             You'll want to override the render function, specify your declarative events, and perhaps the tagName, className, or id of the View's root element.

             When creating a new View, the options you pass are attached to the view as this.options, for future reference.

             <summary>
             If jQuery or Zepto is included on the page, each view has a $ function that runs queries scoped within the view's element.
             If you use this scoped jQuery function, you don't have to use model ids as part of your query to pull out specific elements in a list,
             and can rely much more on HTML class attributes. It's equivalent to running: view.$el.find(selector)

             <summary>
             The default implementation of render is a no-op.
             Override this function with your code that renders the view template from model data, and updates this.el with the new HTML.
             A good convention is to return this at the end of render to enable chained calls.
             Backbone is agnostic with respect to your preferred method of HTML templating.
             Your render function could even munge together an HTML string, or use document.createElement to generate a DOM tree.
             However, we suggest choosing a nice JavaScript templating library. Mustache.js, Haml-js, and Eco are all fine alternatives.
             Because Underscore.js is already on the page, _.template is available, and is an excellent choice if you've already XSS-sanitized your interpolated data.
             Whatever templating strategy you end up with, it's nice if you never have to put strings of HTML in your JavaScript.
             At DocumentCloud, we use Jammit in order to package up JavaScript templates stored in /app/views as part of our main core.js asset package.

             In this fashion, views can be rendered at any time, and inserted into the DOM all at once,
             in order to get high-performance UI rendering with as few reflows and repaints as possible.
             this.el is created from the view's tagName, className, id and attributes properties, if specified. If not, el is an empty div.
