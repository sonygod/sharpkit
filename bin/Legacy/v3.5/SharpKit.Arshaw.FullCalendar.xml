             <summary>
             Immediately forces the calendar to render and/or readjusts its size.
             This method is useful in the scenario where a tab setup might hide/show a calendar. Call this method whenever the tabs are shown.
             Notice that this example calls render whenever any tab is shown, not just the tab that the calendar is within.
             This is okay, because FullCalendar is smart enough to only render calendars that are visible to the user.

            A way to specify elements that will ignore the unselectAuto option.
            Clicking on elements that match this jQuery selector will prevent the current selection from being cleared (due to the unselectAuto option).
            This option is useful if you have a "Create an event" form that shows up in response to the user making a selection. When the user clicks on this form,
            you probably don't want to the current selection to go away. Thus, you should add a class to your form such as "my-form", and set the unselectCancel option to ".my-form".

            A callback that will fire after a selection is made.
            function( startDate, endDate, allDay, jsEvent, view )
            startDate is a Date object indicating the beginning of the selection.
            endDate is a Date object indicating the end of the selection. It follows the same rules as the Event Object for inclusivity/exclusivity: when allDay is true, endDate includes the last day.
            allDay is a boolean indicating if entire days were selected (days in month view or the "all-day" slot in the agenda view) or time slots were selected.
            jsEvent holds the primitive JavaScript event with information such as mouse coordinates. If select has been triggered via the select method, jsEvent will be undefined. (added in version 1.4.7)

            A callback that will fire when the current selection is cleared.
            function( view, jsEvent )
            A selection might be cleared for a number of reasons:
            1. The user clicks away from the current selection (doesn't happen when unselectAuto is false).
            2. The user makes a new selection. The unselect callback will be fired before the new selection occurs.
            3. The user moves forward or backward in the current view, or switches to a new view.
            4. The unselect method is called through the API.
            jsEvent holds the primitive JavaScript event with information such as mouse coordinates. If unselect has been triggered via the unselect method, jsEvent will be undefined. (added in version 1.4.7)

            When set to true (the default), the calendar will only fetch events when it absolutely needs to, minimizing AJAX calls. For example, say your calendar starts out in month view, in February. FullCalendar will fetch events for the entire month of February and store them in its internal cache. Then, say the user switches to week view and begins browsing the weeks in February. The calendar will avoid fetching events because it already has this information stored.
            When set to false, the calendar will fetch events any time the view is switched, or any time the current date changes (for example, as a result of the user clicking prev/next).

            A hash must be supplied that maps button names (from the header) to icon strings. The icon strings determine the CSS class that will be used on the button. For example, the string 'circle-triangle-w' will result in the class 'ui-icon-triangle-w'.
            
            If a button does not have an entry, it falls back to using buttonText.
            
            If you are using a jQuery UI theme and would prefer not to display any icons and would rather use buttonText instead, you can set the buttonIcons option to false.

             <summary>
             Determines the width-to-height aspect ratio of the calendar.
             A calendar is a block-level element that fills its entire avaiable width.
             The calendarâ€™s height, however, is determined by this ratio of width-to-height. (Hint: larger numbers make smaller heights).

            usage

            Triggered when the calendar loads and every time a different date-range is displayed.
            function( view ) { }
            The calendar's date-range changes whenever the user switches to a new view (for example, if they switch from "month" to "agendaWeek") or when they click the prev/next buttons.
            view is the current View Object.
            Within the callback function, this will be set to the calendar's main element.

             If an event is all-day...
             the end date is inclusive. This means an event with start Nov 10 and end Nov 12 will span 3 days on the calendar.

             the end date is exclusive. This is only a gotcha when your end has time 00:00. It means your event ends on midnight, and it will not span through the next day.
