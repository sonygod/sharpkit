            <summary>
            CodeMirror is a code-editor component that can be embedded in Web pages. The code library provides only the editor component, no accompanying buttons, auto-completion, or other IDE functionality.
            It does provide a rich API on top of which such functionality can be straightforwardly implemented. See the add-ons included in the distribution, and the CodeMirror UI project,for reusable implementations of extra features.
            CodeMirror works with language-specific modes. Modes are JavaScript programs that help color (and optionally indent) text written in a given language. The distribution comes with a number of modes (see the mode/ directory), and it isn't hard to write new ones for other languages.

            Finally, the CodeMirror object itself has a method fromTextArea. This takes a textarea DOM node as first argument and an optional configuration object as second.
            It will replace the textarea with a CodeMirror instance, and wire up the form of that textarea (if any) to make sure the editor contents are put into the textarea when the form is submitted.

            <summary>
            Indicates how quickly CodeMirror should poll its input textarea for changes. Most input is captured by events, but some things,
            like IME input on some browsers, doesn't generate events that allow CodeMirror to properly detect it. Thus, it polls. Default is 100 milliseconds.

            Can be used to make CodeMirror focus itself on initialization. Defaults to off. When fromTextArea is used, and no explicit value is given for this option,
            it will be set to true when either the source textarea is focused, or it has an autofocus attribute and no other element is focused.

            <summary>
            When given, this will be called when the editor is handling a dragenter, dragover, or drop event. It will be passed the editor instance and the event object as arguments.
            The callback can choose to handle the event itself, in which case it should return true to indicate that CodeMirror should not do anything further.
            </summary>

        <member name="P:SharpKit.CodeMirror.CodeMirrorConfiguration.onKeyEvent">
            <summary>
            This provides a rather low-level hook into CodeMirror's key handling. If provided, this function will be called on every keydown, keyup, and keypress event that CodeMirror captures. It will be passed two arguments, the editor instance and the key event.
            This key event is pretty much the raw key event, except that a stop() method is always added to it. You could feed it to, for example, jQuery.Event to further normalize it.
            This function can inspect the key event, and handle it if it wants to. It may return true to tell CodeMirror to ignore the event. Be wary that, on some browsers, stopping a keydown does not stop the keypress from firing, whereas on others it does.
            If you respond to an event, you should probably inspect its type property and only do something when it is keydown (or keypress for actions that need character data).
