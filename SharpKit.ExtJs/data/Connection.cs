    /// <summary>
    /// The Connection class encapsulates a connection to the page&#39;s originating domain, allowing requests to be made either
    /// to a configured URL, or to a URL specified at request time. Requests made by this class are asynchronous, and will return immediately. No data from the server will be available
    /// to the statement immediately following the request call. To process returned data, use a success callback
    /// in the request options object, or an event listener. File Uploads File uploads are not performed using normal &quot;Ajax&quot; techniques, that is they are not performed using XMLHttpRequests.
    /// Instead the form is submitted in the standard manner with the DOM &amp;lt;form&amp;gt; element temporarily modified to have its
    /// target set to refer to a dynamically generated, hidden &amp;lt;iframe&amp;gt; which is inserted into the document but removed
    /// after the return data has been gathered. The server response is parsed by the browser to create the document for the IFRAME. If the server is using JSON to
    /// send the return object, then the Content-Type header must be set to &quot;text/html&quot; in order to tell the browser to
    /// insert the text unchanged into the document body. Characters which are significant to an HTML parser must be sent as HTML entities, so encode &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; as &quot;&amp;amp;lt;&quot;, &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; as
    /// &quot;&amp;amp;amp;&quot; etc. The response text is retrieved from the document, and a fake XMLHttpRequest object is created containing a
    /// responseText property in order to conform to the requirements of event handlers and callbacks. Be aware that file upload packets are sent with the content type multipart/form and some server technologies
    /// (notably JEE) may require some custom processing in order to retrieve parameter names and parameter values from the
    /// packet content. Also note that it&#39;s not possible to check the response code of the hidden iframe, so the success handler will ALWAYS fire.
